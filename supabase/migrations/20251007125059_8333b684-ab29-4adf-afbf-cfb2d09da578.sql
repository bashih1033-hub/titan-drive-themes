-- Fix critical security vulnerabilities found in security scan

-- 1. Add INSERT policy for leads table (contact forms need this to work)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can submit contact form"
ON public.leads
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 2. Restrict public access to profiles table
-- (already has good policies, but let's ensure no public access)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON public.profiles;

-- 3. Add INSERT policy for email_logs (system needs to log emails)
CREATE POLICY "System can insert email logs"
ON public.email_logs
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 4. Add INSERT policy for analytics_events (analytics tracking needs this)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can track analytics events"
ON public.analytics_events
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 5. Restrict SELECT on analytics_events to admins only (already exists, verifying)
-- Policy "Admins can view analytics" already exists

-- 6. Ensure profiles table has no public SELECT policy
-- Only admins and users can see profiles (policies already exist)

-- Note: Password protection should be enabled in Supabase Auth settings
-- This cannot be done via SQL migration
